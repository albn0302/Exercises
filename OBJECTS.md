## What are objects?

An obect is a **collection** of **properties** that represent one single **entity**. It can contain related **data** and even **functions**. An object is defined by using **_curly braces_**.

### Example:

```
let myObject = {
  name: "Edmund",
  age: 26,
  hobbies: ["reading", "running", "mountainbiking"]
};
```
