## What is a variable?

A variable works as a **container** for different **values**. A variable can contain **_anything_**, whether it's a so-called **string or number**. A string is a **word or letter** and a number is, well, a number.

### Examples:

```
let a = "hello";
const b = "56";
var c = "old";
```

The differance between these three variable types are that a **let** variable **_can be changed at anytime_** in the code but a **const** is constant which means it **_can't be changed_**. The only way to change a const value is to **hardcode a different one**. The **var** variable is pretty much **_obsolete_**. If this varible type is used you might run into some weird bugs due to it's age.
