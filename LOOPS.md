# JavaScript Fundamentals

## What are loops?

**Loops** in JavaScript **are used for to execute a block of code repeatedly** until a certain condition is met. A **for loop is used when you want to know exactly how many times you want to execute your code**. A **while loop** is used **when you're uncertain on how many times you want to loop your code**.

### Examples:

```
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // The code that executes
}

while (condition) {
  // Your code
  i++;
}
```
