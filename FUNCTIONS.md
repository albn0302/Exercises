# JavaScript Fundamentals

## What are functions?

**A function is reusable code that performs a specific task**.

### Example for a normal function:

```
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // Code that will be executed
  return result;
}
```

There are two ways to write a function. One is **to write it as seen in the first example** which is **the normal type of function**. There are also **arrow functions**, they **are shorter** to write **but it might not always be clear what's happening in them**.

### Example for an arrow function:

```
const myFunction = (parameter1, parameter2, ...) => {
  // The code that gets executed
  return result;
}
```
